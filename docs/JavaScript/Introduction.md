# Introduction

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that powers the dynamic behaviour of most websites. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is a core technology that makes the web run.

## Methods
Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period `.`, the method name and parentheses.
```
Math.random();
```

## Libraries
Libraries contain methods that can be called by appending the library name with a period `.`, method name and parentheses.
```
Math.random();
^ // Math is the library
```

## Numbers
Numbers are a primitive data type. They include the set of all integers and floating point numbers. 
```
let amount = 7; 
let price = 3.99;
```

## String .length
The `.length` property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string.
```
let message = "I should be eating pizza instead"
console.log(message.length);
// prints: 32 (probably, if my counting is correct - spaces included)
```

## Data Instances
When a new piece of data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the program keeps track of it in an instance of that data type. An instance is an individual case of a data type. 

## Booleans
Booleans are a primitive data type. They can be either `true` or `false`.

## Math.random();
the `Math.random()` function returns a floating-point, random number in the range from 0(inclusive) up to but not including 1.
```
console.log(Math.random());
// prints: 0 - 0.9
```

## Math.floor();
The `Math.floor()` function returns the largest integer less than or  equal to the given number 

```
console,.log(Math.floor(5.95));
// Prints: 5
```

## Single line comments 
created with foward slashes. 
```
// this line is a comment
```

## Null
Null is a primitive data type. in represents the intentional absense of a value. in code, it is represented as `null`

```
let x = null;
```

## Strings
Strings are a primitive data type. they are a grouping od characters(lletters, spaces, numbers or symbols) surrounded by 'single' or "double" quotes.

## Arthithmetic Operators
JavaScript supports arthimetic operators for:
```
*** + Addition - 5 + 5 = 10
*** - Subtraction - 10 - 5 = 5
*** * Multiplication - 5 * 10 = 50
*** / Division - 10 / 5 = 2
*** % Modulo / Remainder - 10 % 5 = 0.5
```
