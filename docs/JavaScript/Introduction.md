# Introduction

## JavaScript
JavaScript is a programming language that powers the dynamic behaviour of most websites. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is a core technology that makes the web run.

## Methods
Methods return information about an object, and are called by appending an instance with a period `.`, the method name and parentheses.
```
Math.random();
```

## Libraries
Libraries contain methods that can be called by appending the library name with a period `.`, method name and parentheses.
```
Math.random();
^ // Math is the library
```

## Numbers
Numbers are a primitive data type. They include the set of all integers and floating point numbers. 
```
let amount = 7; 
let price = 3.99;
```

## String .length
The `.length` property of a string returns the number of characters that make up the string.
```
let message = "I should be eating pizza instead"
console.log(message.length);
// prints: 32 (probably, if my counting is correct - spaces included)
```

## Data Instances
When a new piece of data is introduced into a JavaScript program, the program keeps track of it in an instance of that data type. An instance is an individual case of a data type. 

## Booleans
Booleans are a primitive data type. They can be either `true` or `false`.

## Math.random()
the `Math.random()` function returns a floating-point, random number in the range from 0(inclusive) up to but not including 1.
```
console.log(Math.random());
// prints: 0 - 0.9
```
